Cutting grass now emits a default crafting material pickup which the player can "pick up" but currently nothing happens. 

Next step is to get a small system for tracking the materials the player has picked up and once that works I think I'll make a crafting beacon in the world the player can interact with to make stuff. A big reason for doing this in the world is to reduce the amount of UI work needed for crafting (I hope).

Got a basic world moving around and the ability to cut grass. I think I'm going to power ahead and have the grass emit crafting materials as soon as possible so I can get to work on the crafting part of the game.
