# Overview

The main point of the game is to just plant a large garden by casting plant spells. You make the spells from various materials you find cutting grass or that fall from plants.

Due to time constraints there's currently no win/lose goal. You just gradually make a larger and more varied garden.

# Game design stuff

## Creating biomes

Maybe each patch of dirt can have certain thresholds that cause it to convert into a special environment. Special environments might have something like a blendable post processign effects and custom soundtracks. 

Take this image of chrono tigger for example. Perhaps when you hit the forest biome requirements the following happens. 

- We get animated light shafts breaking through when walking through the forst
- Perhaps we darken and add some green tinting while in the forest
- Custom forest music plays while in the forest

## Blendable environments

The idea is similar to Unreal's blendables except this system wouldn't be limited to post processing, it would affect audio, music and other subtle vfx.
